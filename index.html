            <p>Hi, my name is Chris, I am 27 years old and originally from Hollywood, FL. I moved to the Charlotte area in 2008 and graduated from Belmont Abbey
              College in 2014 with Business/Marketing Bachelor's degree. I worked as an office assistant where I interened at Southern Advantage, Co. 
              and then was promoted to shipping manager. After a period of time though, I decided it was time for a change and that I wanted to follow a career
              path that truly interested me. This is when I decided to look into coding and eventually made the decision to join the UNCC Coding Bootcamp.
              I hope to excell in the program and eventually land a job in web development where I hope to begin a long and productive career!</p>

            <p>My interests are history, music, art, video games, movies and current events. My hobbies include going to concerts, art galleries, hiking, practicing
              yoga, reading, and I hope to eventually start mountain biking. My main hobby, however is travel and one of my goals in life is to eventually travel most of the world.</p>

            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
